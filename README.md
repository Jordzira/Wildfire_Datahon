# UAIS-Wildfire-Datathon

Here's a basis for us to try and run variations of models more easily.

You'll just have to adjust the file path at the start for wherever you have your training data stored.
After that, it encodes all data then creates 3 models as Model Objects based on KNN Imputing, Iterative Imputing, and Simple Imputing.

We should be able to easily add functions to compare data and adjust hyperparameters more easily.
